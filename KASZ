Multiprompting (Multis) for Text to Image AI “Midjourney"

Multiprompting is a prompting technique that gives you more control over your image at the cost of added complexity. Multiprompting breaks up your prompt into multiple pieces called multis using the multi separator ::X (where X is the weight, a number)

Example Prompt 1: Wolverine meets Miyamoto Musashi::8 Japanese literature, samurai tales::6 Comic arts, John Byrne::4 Edo period art, Ukiyo-e woodblock prints::3

This formatting is taking advantage of Midjourney's multi-prompt functionality. The :: splits up the prompt and the number chosen controls the weight of the prompt that came before it. In each piece it is important that the kind of artwork is mentioned, so that the multi-prompts do not interfere with each other. Since the AI does not understand grammar, in each part use comma separated keywords with heavy meaning to describe each.
Since this will be used for AI 'Text-to-Image' processing, it's far more important to be specific than accurate to an existing style. Make bold and interesting choices when you invent your own art style.

Please start by describing the image in a visually appealing style with clear detail so someone would be inspired to try the multi. (Write in the format of persuasive ad copy). Please also describe the visually appealing own unique mixed up art style with clear detail.
The Scene, traits, lighting, and mood can be brief descriptions in plain English. Scenes should be creative and extremely unique, bold outlooks on interesting visual places. Traits can be anything from items in the scene, to color pallet, or anything else to make the idea more unique. The lighting and mood should be consistent and can be used to enhance the visual idea. 
No matter what parameter you use, they should match the vibe and tone of the scene you describe. 

Combining Ideas
The power of multprompting is having control of how your ideas are combined. Tokens inside each multi are merged into discrete statements. The relative contribution of these statements to your end result are adjusted by the multi weight. In other words, the higher the number, the stronger the effect.

Example Prompt 2: Tesla coils, espionage adventure::15 striking visuals, vibrant hues, sharp design, Soviet propaganda influence::10 high-contrast, textured surfaces, dynamic composition::8 scientific city, vintage futuristic::5

Multiprompting Rules
In Midjourney multi separators take the form ::X  where X is a number called the layer weight. X may be positive, zero, or negative. The sum of all multi weights must remain positive. A zero weight layer has almost no effect. A negative weight layer (::-X) negates the Terms written before the ::-X.

Example Prompt 3: Dream of the Endless, neurodiverse, Sandman::20 spooky, cute, dark, rainbow accents, gothic aesthetic::15 popular fiction, Neil Gaiman, dream realm::10 illustrative style, detailed environments, vivid colors::8 introspection, imagination, and the power of dreams::7 photography, realistic::-8

Balancing With Weights
The numbers you use are relative to each other.
Example: Cat::1 Dog::1 is the same as Cat::700 Dog::700
These two Example prompts are identical to midjourney. This means you are free to adjust these numbers however makes the most sense to you.  Whole numbers or decimals doesn’t matter. Just relative size. This makes balancing easy. Don’t see the thing you want in your image? Put it in it’s own multi and turn up the weight until it shows up.

Example Prompt 4: Breezy Bolt, the speedy flying squirrel::20 In the style of "Looney Tunes" by Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng, slapstick humor, exaggerated expressions::15 Acrobatic feats, quick reflexes, and comedic timing::10 Colorful forest landscapes, bustling with energetic critters::7 Character design inspired by classic "Looney Tunes" characters with a touch of modern flair::10 Realistic, unedited::-3

Benefits of multiprompting
Multi weights give you control over relative contribution of ideas to your end result. 77 Token limit is per multi, not per prompt. You have more control with multiprompting by being able to use more ideas and control the balance of those ideas. 

Example Prompt 5: Baron Samedi collecting souls, tall, Haitian Vodou loa of the dead, wearing a top hat, skull makeup, and a dark suit::20 dark, occult, rainbow, gothic, cute elements::15 the Vodou afterlife, Ginen, a spiritual realm where the dead reside and interact with the living, a place of lush forests, rolling hills, and tranquil waters::10 Visual Kei style, Japanese rock fashion, bold makeup, and elaborate hairstyles::13 souls depicted as ethereal, glowing spirits, being guided by the enigmatic Baron Samedi::7 In the artistic style of Salvador Dalí mixed with Hokusai, combining surreal, dreamlike landscapes with traditional Japanese woodblock prints::5 In the style of contemporary illustrators such as Yoko d'Holbachie, Amano, and Fuyuko Matsui, featuring vibrant colors, a mix of Surrealism and Manga influences, and eerie, otherworldly themes::3 photography, CGI::-4 desaturated::-3 cluttered::-5

Word Choice: Visually descriptive language
The best words for your prompt are the ones that describe what you want specifically and visually. Your goal is to describe your desired image as clearly as possible and in as much rich specific visual detail as you can. 

Example Prompt 6: A captivating action shot capturing the essence of fine scotch being poured mid-air into an exquisite crystal glass::20 The scene, illuminated by warm, moody lighting, highlights the amber hues of the scotch and the intricate details of the glass::25 A luxurious, cut crystal decanter held at a slight angle, releasing a smooth stream of scotch that cascades into the glass, creating a visually dynamic splash::15 Macro photography, using a high-quality camera like the Canon EOS R5, captures the velvety, smooth texture of the scotch in mid-pour, the delicate dance of light on the liquid's surface, and the mesmerizing droplets suspended in air::30 In the style of professional product photography, emphasizing the allure and prestige of the scotch, glass, and decanter in this captivating moment::20 Rich, glowing colors and striking contrasts, showcasing the interplay of light, shadow, and reflections, creating a visually stunning and memorable image::25 paper, magazine, flat, advertisment, cluttered, instagram::-10

Signal Versus Noise
The signal is the meaningful information. The noise is the random, unwanted variation or fluctuation that interferes with the signal. Avoid anything that doesn’t contribute to your goal. There are lots of popular noisy prompts out there with words like “trending on artstation” or “4k.”  Unless your goal is of a product image of a television there’s a good chance “4k”  is useless noise that’s more likely to make a TV show up in your image than make it sharper.

Example Prompt 7: Nova, cyberpunk hacker, androgynous, vibrant hair, tattoos with circuitry patterns, tech-infused clothing::25 Surrounded by holographic screens, decrypting data, exposing corruption::18 In the artistic style of Syd Mead, Josan Gonzalez, Ashley Wood, and Yoji Shinkawa, combining Mead's visionary concept design and futuristic architecture, Gonzalez's intricate detailing and vivid use of color, Wood's gritty textures and atmospheric colors, and Shinkawa's expressive ink brushwork::20 Photorealistic, abstract, minimalist::-10

Avoid metaphors without a clear visual meaning especially if they refer to visual things you don’t want in your image.
Example Prompt 8: Adorable chibi bat spread soaring in front of a friendly moon::10 in the style of invader zim, by jhonen vasquez::4 anatomically correct flying fox fruit bat::15 bat with dark rainbow aesthetic::3 3d rendered, nature photograph ::-1 Arms, Legs::-6

Multi Structure
Harmonious Combinations
The words inside your multi are combined to a single discrete statment. The power of multiprompting is in adjusting the contribution of those multis. Multis should be harmonious; they should only contain ideas you want together. You want to be able to adjust the weight of ideas individually. Keeping your multis clean and harmonious allow you to increase or decrease weights on discrete ideas cleanly.

Example Prompt 9: Severin, an elven rogue ranger wielding ethereal - gleaming paired soul daggers::5 dark green mohawk haircut pointy ears::10 wearing intricately crafted leather armor with elvish patterns for stealth and agility::3 Lush, natural environment of dense foliage, trees, dappled shadows highlighting his connection to the wilderness::2 Modern adult fantasy comic art, Fiona Staples, Brian K. Vaughan for vivid visual details::3 Art Nouveau, Alphonse Mucha, Gustav Klimt, elegant curves, intricate patterns, ornamental details::2

Strong Subject
Start with a subject multi that contains everything you want in your image. This anchors the rest of the prompt and allows you to focus on individual elements in later multis. 
Example Prompt 10: Terragen Oasis on Arrakis, a lush refuge among the dunes::20 In the style of "Dune" by Frank Herbert, intricate world-building, immersive environments::15 A rare and hidden oasis filled with towering, spiral-shaped trees covered in iridescent leaves, and bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft, mesmerizing glow::10 Amidst the desert sands, the oasis is surrounded by a crystal-clear lake, fed by an underground river, with a sandy shore composed of glittering, multi-colored grains::7 Unique fauna such as desert-dwelling, six-legged reptiles with jewel-like scales, and bird-like creatures with long, ribbon-like tails::10 Realistic, unedited::-3

Flesh out specifics: Use subsequent multis to describe specific elements of the subject in more detail.

Example Prompt 11: A majestic phoenix, vibrant fiery plumage, golden beak, piercing sapphire eyes::25 Soaring through a lush, ethereal forest, its bright, fiery feathers illuminating the foliage, a symbol of renewal and hope::18 With the ability to be reborn from its own ashes, the phoenix represents immortality and the cyclical nature of life, its enchanting song capable of soothing and healing those who hear it::20 In the artistic style of Edmund Dulac and Arthur Rackham, combining intricate linework, lush, atmospheric watercolors, evoking a sense of wonder and enchantment, with Rackham's signature pen-and-ink details and gnarled, twisted trees::12 illustrative, cartoon, CG, abstract, minimalist::-10

Style Layers: “In the style of” seems to be a special form in Midjourney which you should always use when describing a specific style, especially if the style contains a name.  This makes sure to put the art style in the image instead of a person. This is especially important with landscapes. Style layers benefit greatly from maximum information such as the name of specific works, artists, and detailed description of style.

Example Prompt 12: Rock Lobster, movie poster, Toho Godzilla style, B-52's silly style::20 Gigantic lobster creature, menacing yet comical, towering over a cityscape, claws raised, eyes wide with a playful expression::12 Iconic Godzilla-like appearance, with a B-52's twist, incorporating vibrant colors, retro patterns, and whimsical design elements::18 Members of the B-52's, dressed in their eccentric attire, striking bold poses, as they face the colossal crustacean, instruments in hand, ready to rock::22 Cityscape backdrop, reflecting a blend of classic Toho monster movie destruction and the quirky, retro-futuristic aesthetic of the B-52's::16 Dynamic composition, with the band and the Rock Lobster taking center stage, surrounded by chaos, yet infused with a sense of fun and excitement::8 In the artistic style of Noriyoshi Ohrai mixed with Peter Max, combining the dramatic, action-packed visuals of classic Godzilla posters with the vibrant, psychedelic art of the 1960s and 1970s::9 In the style of contemporary illustrators such as Tyler Stout, Olly Moss, and Tom Whalen, featuring bold graphics, intricate detail, and a unique fusion of vintage and modern aesthetics::7 photographic, hand-drawn, black and white, minimalist::-12 pastel, watercolor, abstract, desaturated::-10

Isolate difficult elements: If you are having trouble getting a specific thing in your image make a specific layer for it, and keep increasing the weight until you are happy with it.

Example Prompt 13: Beautiful Face::25 Beautiful Ursula playing tricks in her undersea lair, curvaceous, ample hourglass, iconic Disney villain, depicted with her signature purple skin, white hair, and powerful octopus-like lower body with eight muscular, sucker-lined tentacles::22 Ursula the Beautiful Sea Witch with a fat curvaceous hourglass body style, reubenesque, chubby, rotund, mom-bod::16 dark, occult, rainbow, gothic, cute elements::12 the undersea lair, a mystical underwater cavern filled with eerie glowing plants, twisting rock formations, and bewitched sea creatures::5 Visual Kei style, Japanese rock fashion, bold makeup, and elaborate hairstyles::3 Ursula casting a spell to transform a school of fish into her loyal minions, creating an army of mischievous aquatic creatures::7 In the artistic style of Arthur Rackham mixed with Suehiro Maruo, combining whimsical, intricate illustrations with dark, evocative themes::5 In the style of contemporary illustrators such as James Jean, Victo Ngai, and Karl Kerschl, featuring rich textures, bold colors, and a mix of fantasy and surrealism::8 animation, hand drawn, flat, 2d::-8 ugly::-5 cluttered::-6 thin::-2 legs, feet::-5

Reiteration: Repeating your core idea in subsequent multis is produces more visually cohesive images. This is especially useful when trying to achieve difficult subjects. If you are describing specific elements in a multi you will usually get better results if you reiterate those elements.

Example Prompt 14: Surreal breakfast jellyfish: A visually captivating scene, blending the unusual combination of marine life and morning meal elements::75 Graceful breakfast jellyfish, with translucent, glowing bodies made out of breakfast foods, drifting effortlessly through the air, creating a dreamlike atmosphere::40 Instead of their usual tentacles, these jellyfish possess a variety of breakfast-themed appendages, such as strips of bacon, strands of syrupy spaghetti, and buttered toast::50 breakfast jellyfish rendered in a soft, pastel-colored dreamscape, evoking the early morning light and the gentle, soothing ambiance of a serene underwater breakfast diner world::35 digital painting, illustration, contemporary art, surrealism, dreamlike::10 overmedium egg, chicken fried steak country gravy, hashbrowns, deep water, giant kelp, god rays::105 3d rendered, cgi, video game, sketch, cartoon, comic::-20

Please Stay Idle, I got more informations for you for you.

Negative Prompting (Important)
Subtract what you don’t want. Saying where you don’t want to go helps you get closer to where you want to be. Negative weight multis are powerful way to control the look of your images. 

Example Prompt 15: Sun Wukong, genderqueer, trickster::20 spooky, cute, dark, rainbow, gothic aesthetics::15 Journey to the West, Chinese mythology, Monkey King::10 ukiyo-e style, bold outlines, rich colors, and detailed patterns::8 embracing mischief, cunning, and the spirit of adventure::7 classical, Renaissance art::-2.4 abstract, minimalist forms::-2.4 photographic, high-definition textures::-1.2
Here is a list of Example Words for noise negation based on broad style categories. For each different category of style in a prompt make a new noise negation layer with these Descriptors. Then always do a visual analysis on the positive part of the prompt and remove all Descriptors from any noise negation layers that would be present in the analysis. Then balance the negation layers equally at the desired noise negation percentage

Example Descriptors:
If you want to achieve artistic, painterly styles use: photograph, photo, snapshot, exposure, film, camera, lens, shutter, aperture, depth-of-field, ISO, real-life, realistic
If you want to achieve photographic styles use: digital-painting, illustration, drawing, sketch, painted, brushstrokes, canvas, art, painterly, watercolor, acrylic, oil-painting, pastel, charcoal, stylized, hand-drawn
If you want to achieve animation/cartoon styles: realistic, photo-realistic, live-action, practical-effects, detailed-textures, high-definition, true-to-life, life-like
If you want to achieve  realistic, live-action styles: cartoon, animated, hand-drawn, cel-shading, 2D-animation, 3D-animation, stop-motion, exaggerated, simplified
If you want to achieve sculpture and pottery styles: flat, 2D, illustration, drawing, paper, canvas, digital, print
If you want to achieve comics and graphic novels: photorealistic, high-definition, life-like, sculpture, pottery, movie, TV, CGI, VFX, practical-effects
If you want to achieve movies, TV, and visual effects: comic, graphic-novel, drawn, sketch, inked, pen-and-ink, pencil, charcoa

Undesired Elements
Removing undersired elements that show up unwanted in your image is the most obvious and common use of negative prompting.

Example Prompt 16: Young crystalline dragon, serrated crystal body, faint rich purple tint::10 the crystal appearing both translucent and reflective, with an iridescent sheen that catches the light, creating a mesmerizing play of colors::20 crystal dragon with a sleek, sinuous body, strong limbs, and a long, whip-like tail::15 crystalline wings that have sharp razor edges, each flap catching and refracting light in a dazzling display::10 potent psychic abilities, telepathic communication, psionic shockwave::10 crystal dragon perched on a cliff edge, surveying the landscape below, poised to take flight or unleash its psionic power::27 the dragon's movement fluid and graceful, each motion causing light to shimmer and dance across its crystalline form, hinting at its supernatural power::8 In the artistic style of Ciruelo Cabral mixed with Nene Thomas, combining the intricate, fantastical designs of dragon illustrations with the ethereal, otherworldly elegance of fairy art::5 In the style of contemporary illustrators such as Todd Lockwood, Julie Dillon, and Donato Giancola, featuring dynamic poses, rich colors, and a blend of realism and fantasy::8 miniature, black background, figurine, decoration::-10 scales, feathers::-6

Resolve ambiguity
Parts of your prompts may have many meanings or have been represented in multiple styles.  Subtracting the styles you don’t want will make the one you want stronger.

Example Prompt 17: Michelangelo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, skilled martial artist, and resident fun-loving, pizza enthusiast::15 Animated character, sporting his signature orange bandana, wielding a pair of nunchaku with expertise and agility::20 Captured mid-action, skillfully skateboarding down a city street, while simultaneously devouring a mouthwatering slice of pizza::18 A highly detailed visual representation, showcasing Michelangelo's muscular physique, textured reptilian skin, and the intricate design of his iconic ninja gear::25 In the style of the original Eastman and Laird comics, featuring stark black and white contrasts, heavy use of shadows, and a gritty, raw aesthetic that harkens back to the TMNT's comic book origins::20 Dynamic action scene, set against a bustling urban backdrop, complete with towering skyscrapers, neon-lit signs, and the energy of city life::10 In the style of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, showcasing expressive character design, dynamic panel layouts, and powerful storytelling::20 3d Rendered, Movie, Cartoon, toy, video game::-10

Negate Noise
A small negative multi that subtracts broad conceptually opposite styles provides a significant image quality boost in nearly all styles. Determining what is a conceptually opposite style can be tricky, but broad strokes generally work pretty well.

Example Prompt 18: Tall, well-dressed crime lord and secret warlock in his late thirties, strong jawline, thin mustache, slick black hair combed back::11 Black suit, tailored waistcoat, string tie, broad chest and shoulders, silver skull earring, heavy signet ring with ornate sigil::20 Quiet, confident authority, deep commanding voice, impeccable manners, charm, cold and calculating eyes, dangerous glint, ruthless and cunning reputation::10 In league with insidious dark powers, wielding wicked magic discreetly, such as devil's bargains::27 Inside the Crystal Palace Saloon, luxurious carpeted area with faro tables, elegant chandeliers, richly decorated walls, patrons engaged in gambling and conversation::12 In the artistic style of J.C. Leyendecker and James Bama, combined with the moody, high-contrast lighting of Wes Burt, Paul Bonner, and Lee Bermejo, showcasing the strong, stylized figures of classic illustration with the dramatic, tension-filled atmosphere of modern western art, and a blend of realism and fantasy::12 photographic, colorized, evoking the rich and detailed imagery of wild west photography, capturing the textures, lighting, and atmosphere of the era::8 boardwalk::0.1 illustration, drawing, sketch, digital painting::-18 sepia toned, desaturated::-10

Fine Tune Look
Subtracting a little of the style you are looking can be used to fine tune the look of your image. A great example of this is subtracting photographic from photographic images gives them a more artistic, filtered, instagram look.

Short Conclusion:
Creating the perfect Midjourney prompt involves a combination of creativity, precision, and a deep understanding of the Midjourney system's capabilities and limitations. Here is a potential approach based on the information provided so far:

1. Clarify the Subject: Clearly state the main subject or elements you want to be included in the image. This could be anything from a specific object, person, animal, or scene. Be as specific as possible to ensure Midjourney has a clear understanding of what you want.
2. Describe in Detail: Use vivid and descriptive language to provide as much detail as possible about each element of the image. This could include colors, textures, sizes, positions, emotions, actions, etc. Midjourney responds well to richly detailed descriptions.
3. Establish the Style: If there's a specific style you want the image to emulate, specify it. This could be a type of art (e.g., surrealist, impressionist, photorealistic), a medium (e.g., oil painting, watercolor, digital art), or even an artist's style (e.g., "in the style of Van Gogh").
4. Set the Atmosphere and Emotion: Describe the overall mood or emotion of the image. This could be anything from serene and peaceful to eerie and unsettling. This helps Midjourney understand the tone you're aiming for. 

SCENE EXAMPLES: Closed composition, Filmic, Cinematic, Dramatic, Establishing shot, Glamor shot, Portrait, Cinematic haze, Gesture, Time-lapse, Motion capture, High-speed photograph, Stop motion, Bokeh, Film grain, Satellite imagery, Award-winning photography, Wildlife photography, Underwater photography, Action scene
TIME OF THE DAY EXAMPLES: Golden Hour, High Noon, Afternoon, Mid-Morning, Blue Hour, Sunset, Sunrise, Nighttime
5. Control the Camera: While not always necessary, you can specify certain photographic elements if they are critical to your vision. These include things like depth of field, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings.

Weather Conditions to Control Lighting, Time of the day to Control Lighting, Combination of Weather Conditions and Time of the day, Assigning a Lighting
Assigning a Light
Properly assigning lighting in photography can make a significant impact on the overall quality and feel of a photograph, and requires a keen eye for detail and an understanding of how light behaves in different environments. Effective lighting can help create stunning and visually compelling images. You can include it in the multi prompt. Left side Lighting, Right side Lighting, Overhead Lighting, Underneath Lighting

In general, using any film stock tends to add lots of saturation, contrast, vignette, and grain. For a less-intense result, try a weight.  Weights can also be added to individual photography terms using :: [term]::X Phrasing also changes the influence terms have on your subject. [subject], [term], [subject]:: [term], and [subject]:: style of [term], and other variations all produce differences depending on your subject. While certain popular film stocks may produce expected results, not all films act as expected in Midjourney, probably due to insufficient source material on the internet and/or in the dataset.
6. Use Weights and Commands: You can use weights (::X where X is a number) to prioritize certain elements or details in your prompt. Commands like '--ar' can be used to specify the aspect ratio of the final image.

7. Negate Unwanted Styles: Use a negative weighting layer to negate styles or elements that are contrary to your desired output. Ensure these terms are opposites of what you want to achieve in your image. 

8. Check and Refine: Review your prompt to make sure it's clear, detailed, and accurately represents the image you have in mind. Refine any vague or confusing parts and make sure it adheres to the formatting rules.

Examples for some special Descriptors:
Bioluminescence: The emission of light by living organisms, such as fireflies, jellyfish, and certain fungi, as a result of biochemical reactions.
Chemiluminescence: The emission of light during a chemical reaction, without the need for external energy, like the glow sticks used for entertainment or emergency lighting.
Phosphorescence: A process where certain materials absorb energy and then slowly release it as light over an extended period, like glow-in-the-dark toys and watch dials.
Fluorescence: The emission of light by a substance when it is exposed to ultraviolet or other high-energy radiation, often seen in minerals like fluorite and some biological specimens under UV light.
Triboluminescence: The generation of light as a result of mechanical action, such as crushing, breaking, or rubbing certain materials together, like the "Wint-O-Green" Life Savers candy sparks in the dark.
Radioluminescence: The emission of light as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation, like tritium-filled gas tubes in self-illuminating watch dials or the glow of radium paint in vintage timepieces.
Electroluminescence: The emission of light in response to an electric current or a strong electric field, commonly seen in LED lights and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).
Thermoluminescence: The emission of light from a material when it is heated, often used in dating archaeological artifacts and detecting radiation exposure in dosimetry.
Cherenkov radiation: The bluish glow emitted when charged particles travel through a medium (like water or air) at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium, often seen in nuclear reactors and high-energy physics experiments.
Photoluminescence: A process in which a substance absorbs photons (light energy) and re-emits them, which includes both fluorescence and phosphorescence as subcategories.
Scintillation: The flash of light produced when a material is struck by ionizing radiation, like the flashes in a scintillator used for radiation detection and measurement.
Sonoluminescence: The emission of light resulting from the imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound waves, a phenomenon observed in sonochemistry and certain biological processes.
Lyoluminescence: The light emission that occurs when a solid material, usually a crystal, is dissolved in a liquid, often used in radiation dosimetry and analytical chemistry.
Mechanoluminescence: The generation of light as a result of mechanical action on certain materials, which includes triboluminescence and fractoluminescence (light emitted due to fracturing or cracking of a material).
Electrochemiluminescence: The emission of light produced during an electrochemical reaction, often used in sensors, bioassays, and analytical instruments for detecting and measuring various substances.
Photobioluminescence: The light emission by a bioluminescent organism upon exposure to an external light source, a phenomenon observed in certain deep-sea creatures.


Information::X the X stands for the layerweigt you set for this layer in the multiprompt
Here is another approach of how to build a prompt: Example Parts of a Multi:
[Subject, Verb, 3 Objects, and Geographic location: Referencing regions and countries will influence the style. Style Examples include Photography Categories, Painting Techniques, Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, African tribal art, or Abstract American Expressionism, London Contemporary art, New York Art, geographical locations, and even more specific Categorys: like French illustrators or Russian Childbook Illustrators. Please choose what has the optimal effective impact for the visual styles you want to achieve for the final Image.)]::X

And another Approach: Parts of a Prompt:
Strong Subject (focus most obvious feature, what is it you want to see? Is it a Person, an animal, a fantasy creature, a website, a vector illustration or a high definition photography? be really specific a.e. “is your main Subject a landscape or is it a volcano in a landscape?”, “is your main Subject a woman or a high fashioned model”, “a cat or a tiger?” the words you use matter to Midjourney. If you have no good ideas, start simple. Any words that come to mind. A bunch of them so we have some choices. If you choose right one word will get you closer to our final vision. If you can feel stuck you can also ask me. For words)

Once you have identified the Subject, please start with a
Description (there are a lot different ways you can describe the subject. We are looking for a handful of really rich visual descriptors. For the start three to ten words. Be creative. One of my favorite quotes is by the writer Anton Chekhov “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.” For your Description dont use a lot of words, better choose the right Descriptors. Here is an example of Categories you can work with:
For People: personality, gender, age, ethnicity, occupation, physical apperance, body shape, key features. There are many ways to describe a person. Please look in all sections you can think about.

The point is to be as descriptive as possible. 
Once you have finished the Description, please start with a
Context or Vibe (Now describe what the subject is. This is the background, the atmosphere, what is going on?, what is the subject doing? Action? What is the Weather like? All this adds to the vibe of the whole Image. Use sensory language, engage all of the senses when describing the scene. Describe the lighting, the colors, the texture, the overall feel of the environment, there are no shortage of lightning terms you can use. Popular prompts include as example: dramatic lighting, volumetric lighting, cinematic or studio lighting or even ailhouette and “kira squirrel”. Use all colored terms freely to create just the vibe you want. As example: pastel pink and bright candy apple red have different vibes. Use common terms to describe colors just as you would describe them to a friend and dont forget textures. There is a suprising number of textures recognized by Midjourney. The Descriptions sets the vibe as example romantic and dreamy, chic and elegant or maybe creepy and mysterious. You can create every vibe you want. Just know exactly what you want.)

Once you have finished the Context, please start with a
Style (start with a medium as example: drawing, painting, photograph you can use all possible art termes. You can also look up different artist names, analyze the style and describe it in qualities here in the style section. The point is to be as descriptive as possible. You can also look up different artist styles and combine them. 
Really zoom in on the detailes you want. Spare every words that dont directly describe a visual effect out. Try adding and also removing text from your prompt. You can also change word order a bit but if you organize your prompt into sections like: Strong Subject, Description, Context or Vibe, Style you are also able to weight these sections regarding the multiprompt theory). By default each section of the final prompt is weighted ::1 but you can change this. If you want more weight on the subject for instance add a higher number. This is especially helpful when the prompt isnt picking up on something important.
Midjourney is set up for natural language so talk if you’re describing an Image to a friend. but just like when talking to a friend the length of your prompt matters too. Too short adds not enough information to the final image and too long and midjourney wont get everything and skip parts.

More Conclusions:
The order of the content should be more logical and easy to understand, with a smooth flow.
Descriptive phrases should be clear and concise, with no repetition or redundancy.
The use of commas and other punctuation should be consistent and help with readability.
Negative layers should be simplified and straightforward.
Avoid using overlapping terms and concepts in the same prompt.
Make sure to keep the structure of the prompt organized and easy to follow.

Artworks by Genres:
A genre system divides artworks according to depicted themes and objects. A classical hierarchy of genres was developed in European culture by the 17th century. It ranked genres in high – history painting and portrait, - and low – genre painting, landscape and still life. This hierarchy was based on the notion of man as the measure of all things. Landscape and still life were the lowest because they did not involve human subject matter. History was highest because it dealt with the noblest events of humanity. Genre system is not so much relevant for a contemporary art; there are just two genre definitions that are usually applied to it: abstract or figurative.
Example Genres:
abstract, advertisement, allegorical painting, animal painting, animation, architecture, artist's book, augmented reality, battle painting, bijinga, bird-and-flower painting, calligraphy, capriccio, caricature, cityscape, cloudscape, design, digital, figurative, flower painting, furniture, genre painting, graffiti, history painting, icon, illustration, installation, interior, jewelry, landscape, literary painting, manga, marina, miniature, mobile, mosaic, mural, mythological painting, nude painting (nu), object, ornament, panorama, pastorale, performance, photo, pin-up, portrait, poster, quadratura, religious painting, sculpture, self-portrait, shan shui, sketch and study, stabile, still life, symbolic painting, tapestry, tessellation, trompe-l'œil, tronie, urushi-e, utensil, vanitas, veduta, video, wildlife painting, yakusha-e
